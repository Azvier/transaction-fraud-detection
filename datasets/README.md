> **Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository due to its large size.

## Overview

This dataset contains **5 million** synthetically generated financial transactions simulating real-world behavior. It is suitable for:

- Binary and multiclass classification
- Fraud detection systems
- Time-series anomaly detection
- Feature engineering and model explainability

## Features

Each transaction record includes the following fields:

| `is_fraud`                 | Boolean flag indicating whether the transaction was fraudulent                               |
| `fraud_type`               | Type of fraud (e.g., money_laundering, account_takeover); null if not fraudulent             |
| `time_since_last_transaction` | Hours since the user's previous transaction                                               |
| `spending_deviation_score` | Deviation from normal spending pattern (Gaussian-distributed)                                |
